# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. 
Machine Learning, a set of Algorithms, gives Machines or Computers the ability to learn from data on their own without any human intervention.

# Machine Learning in Data Science
Machine Learning analyzes large chunks of data automatically. Machine Learning basically automates the process of Data Analysis and makes data-informed predictions in real-time without any human intervention. 
A Data Model is built automatically and further trained to make real-time predictions. 
This is where the Machine Learning Algorithms are used in the Data Science Lifecycle.

# Machine Learning Workflow
In doing machine learning we need the stages as below:
* Data Profiling
* Data Cleansing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Pre Processing Modeling
* Modeling
* Evaluate Modeling

# Modeling Workflow
Cross validation and hyperparameter tuning is a method that used to evaluate ML model and optimize it.
## Cross Validation
Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data.
## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning consists of finding a set of optimal hyperparameter values for a learning algorithm while applying this optimized algorithm to any data set. That combination of hyperparameters maximizes the model's performance, minimizing a predefined loss function to produce better results with fewer errors

# Machine Learning Regression
Regression is a technique for  investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. Itâ€™s used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.  

## Linear regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm, commonly used for predictive analysis.

linear regression is a predictive modeling technique. It is used whenever there is a linear relation between the dependent and the independent variables.

### Simple linear regression
Simple Linear regression is a linear regression technique which plots a straight line within data points to minimise error between the line and the data points. 

It is one of the most simple and basic types of machine learning regression. 

This approach is simple because it is used to explore the relationship between the dependent variable and one independent variable.

### Multiple linear regression
Multiple linear regression is a technique used when more than one independent variable is used. 

Polynomial regression is an example of a multiple linear regression technique.

It achieves a better fit in the comparison to simple linear regression when multiple independent variables are involved.


# Time Series
Time series forecasting is basically the machine learning modeling for Time Series data (years, days, hours, etc.)for predicting future values using Time Series modeling .This helps if your data in serially correlated.

Time series forecasting is the task of predicting future values based on historical data.
