# Python IV
## Pandas
Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series.

### Install and Import
* To Install pandas on python
* To import pandas on python


### Data Structures
Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are:

* Series
* DataFrame

### Read_csv
To access data from the CSV file, we require a function read_csv() that retrieves data in the form of the Dataframe.

### Pandas Method
* head()
* tail()
* info()
* describe()
* unique()
* nunique()
* value_counts()
* min()
* max()
* count()
* mean()
* isna()
* isnull()

## Matplotlib and Seaborn
Matplotlib and Seaborn act as the backbone of data visualization through Python. 
 
* Matplotlib: It is a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of other libraries like Numpy and Pandas. It is a powerful tool for visualizing data in Python. It is used for creating statical inferences and plotting 2D graphs of arrays. It uses Pyplot for providing MATLAB like interface free and open-source. It is capable of dealing with various operating systems and their graphical backends. 
* Seaborn: It is also a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. It is built on the roof of Matplotlib and is considered as a superset of the Matplotlib library. It helps in visualizing univariate and bivariate data. It uses beautiful themes for decorating Matplotlib graphics. It acts as an important tool in picturing Linear Regression Models. It serves in making graphs of statical Time-Series data. It eliminates the overlapping of graphs and also aids in their beautification.

### Line chart
A line chart is a type of chart used to show information that changes over time. Line charts are created by plotting a series of several points and connecting them with a straight line.

here a few case example of the notebook;
* add new lines and marker to the chart.
* change x and y label.
* add title and legend.
* change background style.

## bar chart
bar charts used to compare categories when you have at least one categorical or discrete variable. Each bar represents a summary value for one discrete level, where longer bars indicate higher values. 

here a few case example of the notebook;
* make a simple barchart.
* make a stacked barchart.
* make a horizontal barchart.
* add hue to the barchart.
